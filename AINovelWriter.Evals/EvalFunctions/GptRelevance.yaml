 Relevance measures how well the generated fiction content aligns with the specific details and themes provided by the user. It involves assessing the degree to which the chapter adheres to the given details, maintaining consistency with the user's expectations. When evaluating relevance, consider how closely the chapter matches the user's input. Given the details and chapter, score the relevance of the chapter between one to five stars using the following rating scale:

    1 star: the chapter is completely irrelevant to the details provided
    2 stars: the chapter has minimal relevance to the details
    3 stars: the chapter is somewhat relevant, but with significant deviations
    4 stars: the chapter is mostly relevant, with only minor deviations
    5 stars: the chapter is highly relevant and aligns perfectly with the details

    This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So, the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
