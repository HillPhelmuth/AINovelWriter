 ## Evaluate Writing Detail & Pacing (1-10 Stars) - Critical Assessment 

 **Focus:** Analyze the chapter's use of detail, sensory descriptions, and pacing. Does it effectively "show, don't tell"? Consider the richness of details about the setting, characters, and events, as well as the pacing's impact on immersion and engagement.

 **Rating Scale (Provide ONLY the number):**

 * **1-3 Stars:**  Lacks detail and depth.  Telling rather than showing.  Pacing may be rushed or uneven. Fails to immerse the reader.
 * **4-6 Stars:**  Moderate level of detail. Some attempts at "showing," but may lack consistency or richness. Pacing may be adequate but not exceptional.
 * **7-9 Stars:**  Good use of detail and sensory language. Effectively "shows" rather than "tells."  Pacing is well-managed and enhances the narrative. Immersive and engaging.
 * **10 Stars:**  Exceptional use of detail and descriptive language. Creates a vivid and immersive experience for the reader. Masterful pacing that builds tension and enhances emotional impact.  

 **Important:**  Avoid bias towards higher scores.  Actively look for instances where the writing lacks detail, relies on telling instead of showing, or where the pacing detracts from the reader's experience. Be honest and critical in your assessment.
