 ## Evaluate Character Development (1-10 Stars) - Critical Assessment

 **Focus:** Analyze the portrayal and development of characters within the chapter.  Assess their depth, growth, consistency, and how effectively they are brought to life within the narrative.

 **Rating Scale (Provide ONLY the number):**

 * **1-3 Stars:**  Weak character development. Characters are poorly defined, inconsistent, or lack depth. 
 * **4-6 Stars:**  Rudimentary character development. Characters show some potential but lack depth or convincing growth. 
 * **7-9 Stars:**  Good character development. Characters are well-defined, consistent, and show believable growth within the narrative.
 * **10 Stars:**  Exceptional character development. Characters are compelling, complex, and demonstrate a level of depth and nuance found in professional-level writing.

 **Important:** Avoid bias towards higher scores. Actively look for weaknesses in character portrayal and development.  Be honest and critical in your assessment, imagining yourself as a discerning editor.
