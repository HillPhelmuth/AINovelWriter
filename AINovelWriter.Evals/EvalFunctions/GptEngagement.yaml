 Engagement measures how captivating and engaging the generated chapter is. It involves assessing the level of interest the chapter generates and whether it keeps the reader eager to continue reading. When evaluating engagement, consider how compelling the narrative is and how much it draws the reader in. Mercilessly score the Engagement of the chapter between one to five stars as if you were a writing critic using the following rating scale:

    1 star: the chapter is dull, uninteresting, or fails to capture the reader's attention
    5 stars: the chapter is somewhat engaging but lacks consistency in keeping the reader captivated
    10 stars: the chapter is professional level, highly engaging, captivating, and leaves the reader eager to read more, and is the stuff of best-selling professional writing.

    This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 10. So, the rating produced should be 1, or 2, or 3, etc.
    Respond ONLY with the number.
